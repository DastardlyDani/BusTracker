# Bus-Tracking 
Map showing all the bus stops to Harvard. Animated.

## Viewing
to view the html, JavaScript, and CSS style sheet please click onn the Bus Tracking Folder to open and review the code. 

## Intro 
With the use of API keys, we were able to source the script to use a Boston section of a mapbox in order to animated a marker, representing a bus as it goes
through several stop before reaching Harvard University. The Bu Stops were manually inputted into the JavaSctipt with a counter to show the bus stop length before 
moving to the next stop. There are twelve stops in addition to the starter stop where the marker starts. The CSS Scripting was predominantly for the button on the top
right to trigger the animation. 

## How to Use 
To start the animation, press the button on the top right t hat states "Show Stops" 

## How to Better the project
Would prefer smooth continous animation rather than rapid stops, to simulate more of that real time experience.
